# TeamBuilder (Challenge 10)

## About
TeamBuilder is a simple Inquirer-based app that allows users to create a team of employees by entering information via the terminal, and then rendering the information given in a Bootstrap-styled webpage. 

It was created for a weekly assignment and imagines the main user demographic to be managers or team leaders.

### Demonstration
See [the video demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GccFWrAMmpSGGNXfqzXGtylB8e49VRja/view) for a quick demonstration of how to use the app. This video also demonstrates the app passing a few Jest tests, per the assignment criteria.

## Installation & Use
1. Download the repo. All required files are included.
2. Navigate to the repo's root folder in your terminal of choice. 
3. Start the app by running `npm run start` in your terminal.
4. You'll first be asked to enter a manager's information before being given the option to add a new engineer, intern, or to exit the app. 
5. All employees, manager included, will be saved and rendered to an html page (./myteam.html) in the root directory when you choose to quit. Open the file to view your team.

### Testing
If you'd like to run the existing tests, run `npm run test`.
